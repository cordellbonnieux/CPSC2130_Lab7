Description:
This is a simple game, or demonstration using BABYLON.js. You are a ball which is located inside of a box, there are
boxes all around you which have a very low mass, while you have a very high mass. So, you jump around and knock into things and send them flying. There are also two ominous 'kitty-discs', which the player can activate with the shift key. Enjoy!
